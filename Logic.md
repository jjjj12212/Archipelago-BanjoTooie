# Warning: this logic is very outdated. This doc will be updated (or deleted) at some point.
# Current Logic Implementation | 1.8-Beta

We currently have 4 logics put in place.


The beginner logic only expects intended strategies. This logic is aimed at people that don't know the game too well.

The normal logic expects certain tricks and unintended strategies, such as pack whack jumps or shooting the fire egg switch without egg aim. This is recommended for people that are familiar with the game. This is the default option.

The advanced logic may expect almost all the tricks to be done. This logic includes strategies or tricks like defeating Terry without egg aim, or getting the Quality Control jiggy as Banjo. This logic is aimed at people that are familiar without speedrun tricks and are looking into applying those tricks in harder or more obscure scenarios. Some of the harder tricks were left out of this logic.

The glitched logic will expect all the reasonable glitches to be done, as well as all the tricks from the advanced logic. This logic is aimed at people that are familiar with glitches in Banjo-Tooie and are willing to use them in a randomiser. This logic does not take Bit Clips and the Delayed Cutscene Warp into account.
