# Current Logic Implementation | v1.0.0-Beta

We currently have 3 logics put in place. None of them require glitches.


The beginner logic only expects intended strategies. This logic is aimed at people that don't know the game too well.

The normal logic expects certain tricks and unintended strategies, such as pack whack jumps or shooting the fire egg switch without egg aim. This is recommended for people that are familiar with the game. This is the default option.

The advanced logic may expect almost all the tricks to be done. This logic includes strategies or tricks like defeating Terry without egg aim, or getting the Quality Control jiggy as Banjo. This logic is aimed at people that are familiar without speedrun tricks and are looking into applying those tricks in harder or more obscure scenarios. Some of the harder tricks were left out of this logic.
